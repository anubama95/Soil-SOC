### Soil Organic Carbon
Soil samples are collected at three different depths (0-5 cm, 5-10 cm, 10-15cm) from three different areas (Forest area, Field area and Seashore area) over the Thamirabharani river belt region. The SOC content in the soil is classified as Organic High, Organic Medium, Organic Low and Inorganic with respect to the depth.

Soil fertility is the ability of the soil to supply essential plant nutrients and water in adequate amounts and proportions for plant growth and reproduction. Soil organic carbon is the key property for soil fertility. Quantifying soil organic carbon (SOC) is an important process for soil management, precision agriculture and soil mapping.
